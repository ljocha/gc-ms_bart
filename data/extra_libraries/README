This dataset was downloaded from https://littlemsandsailing.com/2023/10/free-ei-and-msms-spectra-in-nist-format/ and converted to SDF/MSP with the LIB2NIST tool. Moe details about the datasets in the read_me.pdf attached.

The datasets were further annotated and filtered with the following notebook: ~/notebooks/extra_libraries_annotation.ipynb
