Origin of the files (maybe make nicer later)

- SWGDRUG_3.MSP and SWGDRUG_3.SFD files were converted from the originalNIST format files using LIB2NIST (see README in parent folder)
- SWGDRUG_3_annotated.MSP and SWGDRUG_3.jsonl were created with the notebook data/extra_libraries_annotation.ipynb
- the "_noD" in naming means removing compounds containing deuterium - as they are not present in the NIST dataset (only couple of them like max 30)
- unlike in ~/data/datasets in this dataset were omitting only train NIST20 compounds and all new 4.5M NEIMS_gen train molecules
- SWGDRUG_3_with_db_index.jsonl was created with the following command:
```bash
FP_TYPE=morgan
SIMIL_FUN=tanimoto

python ../precompute_db_index.py \
           --reference ../data/datasets/NIST/NIST_split_filip/train.jsonl \
           --query ../data/datasets/extra_libraries/SWGDRUG_3/SWGDRUG_3.jsonl \
           --outfile ../data/datasets/extra_libraries/SWGDRUG_3/SWGDRUG_3_with_db_index.jsonl \
           --fingerprint_type ${FP_TYPE} \
           --fp_simil_function ${SIMIL_FUN} \
           --num_processes 32
```
