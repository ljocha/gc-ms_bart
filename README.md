# SpecTUS: Spectral Translator for Unknown Structures annotation from EI-MS spectra

**SpecTUS** is a transformer-based tool for reconstructing Gas Chromatography-Electron Ionization (GC-EI) mass spectra. The model reconstructs spectra in a de novo manner — directly translating the spectra into 2D molecular structures represented as SMILES strings. The model is pretrained on a large dataset of synthetic spectra and fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of experimental NIST20 spectra. The NIST20 is a proprietary dataset; therefore, we cannot share the final model, but the code for training the model is carefully documented and available for public use. If you own a license for the NIST20 dataset, you can train the model yourself or contact us to get it.

We make freely available the 17.2M synthetic spectra used for pretraining the model and the checkpoint of the pretrained model that
can be further finetuned on your own dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/MS-ML).

```

## 🛠 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SpecTUS.git
   cd SpecTUS
   ```
2. Set up the Python environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f trainSpectus_build.yaml
   ```

## 🚦 Usage
Data preprocessing, pretraining, finetuning, hyperparameter search, model evaluation, and comparison of the models are all described step by step in the [notebooks/](notebooks/).

An example notebook for [inference](notebooks/5_inference_on_open_data.ipynb) is available to help you get started reconstructing spectra from an `msp` file once you have your model trained.
